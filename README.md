# FPGA-VSD-Projects

## FPGA:
1) The FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array), used for implementing and coding programs.
2) It is powered by the Lattice UltraPlus ICE40UP5K FPGA.
3) It offers 1 megabit of single port RAM (Random Access Memory), 120 kilobits of Dual Port RAM, and 8 multipliers which helps the chip to solve logical math problems for versatile design
   capabilities.
4) The Lattice UltraPlus ICE40UP5K FPGA has 5,040 Logic Cells (Approximately 5.3K Look-Up Tables).

## Connectivity:
1) The board has been equipped with Future Technology Devices International Future Technology 232H (FTDI FT232H USB to Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) device for smooth interaction of messages between the devices.
2) Future Technology Devices International pins can be accessed through test points for optimization and easy troubleshooting.

## General Purpose I/O (GPIO):
1) The total GPIOSs in the FPGA are brought out for painless 

## Memory:
